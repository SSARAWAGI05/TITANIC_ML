## About The Project
This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset using machine learning algorithms to predict survival outcomes based on passenger features like age, sex, and fare. The project compares two machine learning models: **Random Forest Classifier** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, applying cross-validation to evaluate the model performance. Additionally, it performs data visualization using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to gain insights into survival rates based on factors like gender and passenger class.

---

## Built With
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and evaluation methods.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, download the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and follow the instructions to set up the environment, install dependencies, and run the analysis code.

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SSARAWAGI05/TITANIC.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd TITANIC_ML
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies (listed below).

---

## Dependencies
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Problem Statement
The Titanic dataset is a classic machine learning problem where the objective is to predict whether a passenger survived based on various features. The dataset contains missing values and outliers, which need to be handled properly. The main goals are:
1. Clean and preprocess the data.
2. Train and compare different classification models.
3. Visualize survival distributions and analyze key factors influencing survival.

---

## Key Features
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Z-Score method to remove outliers based on the `Fare` column.
   - Handling missing values using linear interpolation.
   - Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.

2. **Model Comparison**:
   - **Random Forest Classifier** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** are trained and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation.
   - Mean cross-validation scores are calculated for model comparison.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Survival Rate by Gender**: Visualizes survival differences between male and female passengers.
   - **Survival Rate by Class**: Compares survival rates across different passenger classes.
   - **Age Distribution**: Shows the age distribution of passengers and how it relates to survival.
